TODO: 
+In getNumberOfSamples(): Time after needs to be tested. 500ms seems good, but it will depend on the size of the cargo. Consider creating a function to calculate how long it will take.
+In getPacketReservTime(): samples_no_cargo is hardcoded. It should be fixed in the future. 
+In ToRawFileTX(): The function can be changed to void since it doesn't need to return a value.
+In config(): Add an option to choose the threshold.
+In startTX(): Wait for Janus and sdmsh to exit. This can be used to determine if there is a fault in the TX. If we wait too long, something is wrong. Consider using poll.
+In startTX(): Add an optional variable for the time before exiting poll.
+In startTX(): Consider using waitpid with poll to handle potential errors and read error messages.
+In listenRX(): Add an optional variable for the poll timeout.
+In listenRX(): Remove std::this_thread::sleep_for(500ms). It may not be necessary.
+When using poll, remove non-blocking mode. It will improve performance. Test the code after removing it. (was orginaly taken away by us)
-This is something that can cause the read to enter else when the pipe is empty. Test it by removing non-blocking mode.
+In listenRX(): Close the pipe in the read() else{} block.
+In listenRX(): Add an option to print the janusframe to a file for easier reading.

Future: 
There are alot of errors that have not been handeled in a proper way. We need to do more testing and impliment new metods for detecting and handeling errors
- Error: on the modems, look at feedback from streams.
- Error: in janus: look at feedback from streams 
- Error: on the system, handling of processes
- Error pipes and other stuff like this







Old comments: 
startRX: 
        //Part of RX fam: -> read dokumentation before use 
        //Begins the sdmsh and janus commands for RX, 
        //Creates a pipe connected to a output stream from janus, read end of pipe is returned (pipe[0])
        //1. Need to set modem in PHY mode 
        //2. Need to run a "sdmConfig.." and a "setPreamble" before first time running this commands.
